# ShowStopper

Audio program for stage sound, currently in very early construction. 

## Status

This is currently just a bootrapped project, while I pull together the bits I want to tie together

* Code is in place to use an item list with glade generated user interface for each item
* Code written to use json serialisation of the project model
* Example code for gstreamer playing of a file
* Quick implementation of an LED on items
* Example code for observer pattern (from StackOverflow)

## Targets

* Play the next file when the play button is pressed
* Enable the previous and next buttons
* Generate the item list from the model
* Put a "new item" button on the item list


Written to play with: PyGtk, GStreamer
